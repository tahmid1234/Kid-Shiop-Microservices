open terminal and type :
npm install -g firebase-tools

Then, open VS Code ,go to the project folder open terminal in the functions folder or use "cd functions" command to traverse to it.
then type in the terminal :

functions$ npm run serve


run both service parallely.

You will get a link from the terminal like this:
+  functions[app]: http function initialized (http://localhost:8080/microserviceproduc/us-central1/app).
you can open the link in browser and to check the functionalities, use postman. 

setting ports:
port 8080 and port 5001 are set for product service and rating service respectively.
If port error shows up
  go to firebase.json file set  any open port value and run again.
  or  kill the process running on port using-
	fuser -k {port_value}/tcp-> fuser -k 5001/tcp or fuser -k 8080/tcp
p.s.: if product service port is changed to anything other than 8080, go to index.js file of rating service and in line 59, update the port number from 8080 to the new port number of product service.The line contains a word - 'axios.put'
